Rule Based Classification For Potential Income of New Customers

### Business Problem:

A game company wants to create new level-based customer definitions (personas) by using some features of its customers. They want to create segments according to these new customer definitions and estimate how much the company will earn from the new customers according to these segments.

The Persona.csv dataset contains the prices of the products sold by an international game company and some demographic information about the users who buy these products. The data set consists of records created in each sales transaction. This means that a user with certain demographic characteristics may have made more than one purchase.

PRICE – Customer's spending amount
SOURCE – The type of device the customer is connecting to 
SEX – Gender of the client 
COUNTRY – Country of the customer 
AGE – Age of the customer
